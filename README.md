# LaTeX CV Template for Students and Engineers

This is my LaTeX CV Template repository. This LaTeX class is designed to create a clean and professional CV

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install a LaTeX distribution such as [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/), or use it on Overleaf.
3. Open the `developercv.cls` file with your LaTeX editor.
4. Customize your CV by editing the placeholders with your information.
5. Compile the document to see the changes.

## Structure

- **developercv.cls:** This is the LaTeX class file that defines the layout and styling of the CV.
- **main.tex:** The main LaTeX file where you can add your personal information and details.

## Note
This latex class was created by Omar Roldan in overleaf and modified by Mengge Zhang.
